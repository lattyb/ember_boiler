Ember + Foundation
===========

This is a straight up clean build of ember with foundation on top. I'm still experimenting with how these two guys like to live together so I take no resposibility over any show stopping bugs :)

To Run
=====

Just download the package and open index.html. Make sure you have Grunt installed since you'll need it to compile your sass code. To do that just navigate to the directory and run the "grunt" command.
